The public service community laboratory association, Hackuarium, has been monitoring recreational water quality on Lake Geneva with eight-week summer sampling campaigns in Montreux since 2016. This pulls together analyses and summarises results of this volunteer work.

## Introduction

Lifeguards from Montreux, who had participated in an open summer school around nanotech devices to detect pollution, joined in for one of the regular Hackuarium evenings, #OpenHackuarium, in February 2016 for brainstorming about ways to locally monitor lake water pollution.  Microbiological assays were suggested, as used already for several citizen science efforts by groups like WaterWatch. 


## Pariticpating orgainzations

* Needs to be completed

## Research questions

* Needs to be verified

### Does the lake, in the area of concern, exceed bathing water quality standards durring the event?

* Definition of bathing water quality standards?
* Defined by the average number of bioindicators per sampling day?
* Defined by the probability that a collected sample will exceed the standard?


### In general did the bathing water quality standards improve after the upgrades to the local network?

* Description of upgrades?
* Defined by the average number of bioindicators per sampling day before and after the upgrades?
* Defined by the probability that a collected sample will exceed the standard before and after the upgrades?

## Conclusions

* state the conclusions
* more information
